Protocols for Meetings Held In Office Premise
April 21, 2023 
These are mandatory protocols that need to be followed when hosting meetings in the office.
THINGS TO DO BEFORE THE MEETING IS SET 
1.	Confirm the Meeting Date & Time with the Client.
2.	Send a Meeting Invite referencing the Client Meeting.
3.	If the Client is Unsure of the Date & Time please make sure to send the Meeting Invite with the Subject as TENTATIVE or else Subject Line needs to indicate CONFIRMED.
4.	Mandatorily send an email to hr@bww.one with Cc support.lead ; hr.lead ( reference the sample email below)
THINGS TO DO ON THE DAY OF THE MEETING.
1.	Ensure to arrive on time in Office.
2.	Ensure to be appropriately attired.
3.	Ensure the Office Admin has completed the needed tasks as required.
4.	Ensure to check for internet connections and TV Usage working.
5.	Make sure to keep colleagues informed of Clients’ visits so that they can be discreet in their conversations especially when using the lunch room.
6.	Once the Client Arrives it’s nice to send a WhatsApp or BC Message stating Client Arrived and the Same for when the Client Leaves. Again you can always ask your colleague to post this message on your behalf.. this is basically so that all present in the office are aware of the Client’s presence.
Sample of the Client Meet Email to be Sent to HR – pls edit client preferences as required
Hi
Greetings!
This email is to inform you that, we have a client coming to the office on 2nd May 2023 at 11am for a meeting.
Client name: Mr. Herbert ( from Switzerland ) and Tharaka ( from Srilanka )
Duration of the meeting: 1 – 2 hours
People attending from the BWW team: Myself , Dushantha and Rajith
Meeting room: Top meeting room (Let’s make sure that the A/C is working fine )
Car park: Yes they will be coming by car so we need a reserved parking space.
Snacks and drinks: We need to arrange some cookies and be ready for tea/coffee. Let’s have cool drink as an option as well due to the severe weather.
EXTRA Instructions: Since the meeting may extend around 12pm please make sure there is no noise reflected from the lunch room. Please put a Notice as required. 
I will send you a meeting invite as well so that we don’t miss anything.
Let me know if anything is unclear.
Thank you
Best Regards,

Email Setup Advisory Team
Dear ,
Greetings from the Email Setup Advisory Team at BenWorldwide!
As your trusted partners in ensuring seamless email experiences, we wanted to share some insights about the available email connection options and our collective recommendations.
POP (Post Office Protocol) vs. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
Here’s a simple analogy to understand the two:
POP (Post Office Protocol): Picture this as a mailbox outside your house. When mail is delivered, you take it out and store it inside your home (this is akin to downloading emails to your laptop). Once you’ve collected the mail, the mailbox is empty.
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): IMAP lets you peer into a mailbox stationed far away at a central post office (the email server). You view, read, and organize the mail, but it remains in that distant location. You’re simply accessing a remote view.
Why we recommend POP for your setup:
1.	Local Storage: POP ensures that emails are directly stored on your laptop or device. This means even without an internet connection, your emails remain accessible.
2.	Efficient Data Management: IMAP, over the years, can pile up substantial data since it continuously syncs with the server. For those with expansive email storage or less frequent inbox upkeep, this could lead to server-side performance snags.
3.	Mitigated Server Worries: Online email storage, while handy, has its risks. If the server experiences issues like crashes or security breaches, there’s a potential loss of all emails stored there. With POP, your emails’ local storage reduces this concern considerably.
A Note of Caution on IMAP:
Many users favor IMAP for its real-time syncing benefits. However, we urge you to be mindful of its associated risks. If you lean towards IMAP, please recognize that while we, at BenWorldwide, furnish our top-tier advice and recommendations, we cannot bear responsibility for any possible data loss or linked complications from using this protocol.
To sum up, your choice in email setup should resonate with your requirements and comfort with risk. If email security and effective data management stand out as priorities, POP becomes a strong contender.
For any queries or additional support, our team remains at your beck and call. Ensuring your optimal digital journey is paramount to us.
Warm Regards,
The Email Setup Advisory Team,
BenWorldwide
DND (Do not Disturb Mode)
August 10, 2023 
 
DND Mode is for associates to focus without getting disturbed highly
For Associates who want to go on DND
1.	Ensure you are on Hubstaff
2.	Inform via BC or chat method when you go off on DND with an approx time you will be back
3.	Make sure the phone call method or an emergency number is available
4.	Once you are back please post a message
For others
1.	Disturb only if it is a critical issue (site or server down)
2.	Send emails instead of disturbing
3.	Plan your day and work around DND
You can also set the BC Mode

When a client has zero nodes /moving out
Dear Sir,
Greeting from BenWorldwide !
Thank you for your patience,
We regret to inform you that we will not be able to complete the profile update due to insufficient node balance.
Please be kind enough to sign up for the maintenance and avoid interruption.
For more details please get in touch with our accounts team via accountteam@bww.one
Stay safe !
BenWorldwide Maintenance Package Options
October 28, 2022 
Please note: Currently we do have two option’s available for maintenance work
Option 1 Advance Deposit Package
•	We will hold some deposit for particular account and admin can send a support request to support@bww.one and team will analyze the workings and the work cost we will reduce the ticket cost from the outstanding deposit.
*This is basically Nodes Package. Client’s who has signed up with us e.g. CSC, Colombo Dock Yard etc..
*We are not going to share any monthly report unless client request from us
Option 2 Cost Per Request (C.P.R) Package
•	We can proceed with the costing case by case. Let me explain the process: 
o	Client can send a support request to support@bww.one
o	Team will analyze the workings and the work costing will be sent by marketing team OR accounts team
o	Client needs to APPROVE & PAY FOR the work estimate
o	AFTER payment protocols are cleared ticket request will be assigned and looked at based on resources availability )
*In summary of proposed options:
Option 1 (Advance Deposit Package) – We can plan out the work asap and we can save time since we are reducing the ticket cost from the advance deposit (This is a faster approach if we are going to compare with Option 2)
Option 2 (Cost Per Request) – When a support ticket comes it will takes some time to resolve as we have to follow the process.
*Special Note: Option 2 basically we don’t have to rush and do it but always make sure to check with the team and take the right decision.
E.g. If the development team don’t have work Or any urgent ticket our approach may change
 
 
 
Problem clients – Please check with Marketing before replying
October 20, 2022 
Mcentre
We have many times told this client to revamp the shop. The shop is outdated. We can charge good hours. Please do not attend immediately if you get any tickets. Always double-check check with Project and then proceed with the task
Paradise Road
This client is no longer with BWW. Please do not attend to any tickets
Kelani Cables
They have a big concern about our calculation method. We got several complaints from them that we have overcharged them. Actually, we are charging very reasonably. Let us charge good hours. However when you get a ticket please make sure to check with double check with Rajith
Support Email
October 20, 2022 
•	When sending support emails, please use “Thank You” rather than “Thanks!”
•	Kindly avoid using exclamation marks. Since it needs to be used very sparingly.
•	Correct Signature Format for support emails, 
o	“Stay Safe and remember we are there to support you any timeKind Regards
Support Agent”

How to create full cPanel backup
October 18, 2022 
1.	Login to cPanel
2.	Make sure available disk space is enough to take the backup. Check and delete any zip file backups before making the new backup. Generally, it will require 90%  of the current used space. (ex. If 1GB space is used you need another 900MB for the backup.)
3.	Go to Backup Wizard. Most of the time this is placed under the Files section
 
4. Click Backup
 
5. Click Full Backup
 
6. Keep the destination as Home Directory and give your email address to receive a notification after the backup is completed. Then click Generate Backup
 
7. Backup generation time will depend on the size of the account. This backup can transfer/migrate the entire cPanel to different servers.
8. Remember to delete the backup when the task/change/update is completed to conserve disk space.

BWW POLICIES FOR ALL ASSOCIATES (MUST READ)

Virtual Meeting Protocols
April 28, 2023 
Virtual meetings have become a regular part of our lives, especially in today’s remote work environment. However, conducting virtual meetings is not as easy as it seems. Without proper virtual meeting protocols in place, it can be challenging to conduct a productive and successful virtual meeting.
 
1.Be Prepared
The first step in having a successful virtual meeting is to be prepared. Ensure that you have everything you need for the meeting, including any necessary documents, files, or presentations. Make sure that your internet connection and video conferencing software are working properly.
2. Set an Agenda
To ensure a successful virtual meeting, it is essential to have a clear agenda. An agenda will help keep the meeting focused and on track. It will also help ensure that all the necessary topics are covered during the meeting. Share the agenda with all participants before the meeting to give them time to prepare and provide input.
3. Dress Appropriately
Virtual meetings may be conducted from the comfort of your home, but it’s important to dress appropriately. Dressing professionally can help set the tone for the meeting and ensure that all participants take the meeting seriously. It’s also important to avoid wearing clothes that blend into your background or that may be distracting.
4.Minimize Distractions
To ensure a productive virtual meeting, it’s essential to minimize distractions. Find a quiet and well-lit area for the meeting. Turn off your phone and close any unnecessary tabs or applications on your computer. Doing so will help ensure that you are fully focused on the meeting.
5.Follow Virtual Meeting Etiquette
Virtual meeting etiquette is just as important as in-person meeting etiquette. It’s important to follow virtual meeting etiquette to ensure that the meeting is respectful and professional. Some virtual meeting etiquette includes:
•	Muting your microphone when you’re not speaking
•	Raising your hand if you want to speak
•	Avoiding multitasking during the meeting
•	Avoiding interrupting other participants
•	Waiting for your turn to speak
6.Summarize and Follow-Up
At the end of the meeting, summarize the main points discussed and any assigned action items. Share the meeting summary and action items with all participants after the meeting. Following up after the meeting will help ensure that all action items are completed and that the meeting was productive.
Few things to keep in mind. 
•	We have a background design which we always use for any internal/external meeting. ( See below ) Make sure to always use this.
 
•	Choose a well-lit area: Make sure the area you are in is well-lit so that your video is clear and your background image is visible. Natural light is best, so try to sit near a window if possible.
•	Check for virtual background compatibility: If you’re using Zoom, make sure that your computer is compatible with virtual backgrounds. Older computers or slower internet connections may not be able to handle virtual backgrounds properly.
•	Test your background beforehand: Before the call, test your background to make sure it looks good and that your image is visible. You can do this by previewing your video in Zoom or Google Meet.
•	Use a high-quality camera: A high-quality camera will ensure that your image is clear and that your background looks good. Consider investing in a good webcam or using a high-quality smartphone camera if you don’t have access to a webcam.
•	Position yourself properly: Make sure that your camera is positioned at eye level and that you are centered in the frame. This will ensure that your background image is visible and that you are not cut off from the frame.
•	Avoid wearing colors that blend into your background: Make sure the color of your clothing does not blend into your background image. This will make it difficult for others to see you clearly.
•	Test your audio and video settings: Make sure your audio and video settings are working properly before the call. This will ensure that your background image looks good and that you are not experiencing any technical issues.
•	Be aware of your body language: Your body language can affect how others perceive you on the call. Sit up straight and maintain good eye contact to show that you are engaged and attentive.
•	Use a headset or microphone: Using a headset or microphone will ensure that your audio is clear and that others can hear you properly. This will also help to reduce background noise.

Policies for Project Managers (Applicable for all in general)
March 17, 2021 
Be connected 24X7
When you join BenWorldwide expect your life to change. People who believe in work life balance will find it extremely hard to adjust.
We deal with Clients across multiple borders therefore we are always connected 24×7. Poya days mercantile holiday weekend should be a factor in our communication to client. We continue to enjoy our families and have fun however we don’t stop being connected.
If you cannot be connected, then you should choose a different field. It is about the passion you have. A person who is passionate about music cannot be stopped from being glued to the instrument he or she loves. The most important focus for that person is the instrument likewise as we are passionate about the Company & the Technology you need to have a real honest passion to be connected.
Tools we use
Like in any trade the tools we use are important. Without tools, we cannot excel at what we do.
A woodsman cares about his tools at the end of the day he services and polishes them and handles and keeps there with care.
A chef takes care and organizes his kitchen equipment’s/tools.
BWW is no different, your tools are your Laptop and Mobile phones.
If you have a problem understanding these two then you need to revisit and ask if this is  the right career/company you have chosen. Your Laptop needs to be in best running conditions (Not necessarily new) but make sure to keep it  well-updated with the latest software. Your phone needs to be updated and your notification etc. need to be working perfectly. You also need to check your laptop and mobile often
Keep your mobile phone ALWAYS with you, don’t leave in your desk and go around.
Ensure you understand these devices very well. Don’t just run to someone and say somethings are not working, find out in Google and see to fix it yourself.
The reason is you will never know when a client might ask for some advice and knowledge is power
Learn to Respect others –
When you join BWW you are joining a company which is constantly changing and learning, you are joining a team of people some who are new and some who are years inside the company. They share the rich heritage in knowledge & growth. Respecting everyone is a crucial element you need to develop.
How can you respect others?
i/ Give the proper greeting when addressing anyone
ii/ Reply their emails on time, a delay or a silence is a sign of disrespect
iii/ Whatever critical comments you may receive from others take it with humility and respect
iv/ Don’t take any advice of instruction in an offending manner
v)Remember we are all dealing in a Professional Environment & nothing is Personal
Work Hard
At BWW we work round the clock on duty, that is because our company was built on hard work. Also our clients work around the clock. If you are looking for weekends off and mercantile holidays then this is not the company for your to choose.
The IT line you have chosen for never goes down or never goes to sleep. Our ethos also has to be the same.
Be always connected and reply emails or messages as fast as possible. When not in position to do so have a back up.
The key to understanding is Keeping All Informed minimizes Miscommunication which further gives you more time on hands.
Communication
Prior to joining BWW you may be used to Chat communication or English Slangs. In general when you receive a message or email you usually prefer replying in acronyms like BRB ; LOL ; ASAP etc etc
In an official world this has to change, both for internal and external company communication please don’t use syllables
When a client or internal senior sends you a chat to check on something, don’t reply as
Will check and come back
please start with official communication
Dear XX
Noted your Whatsapp
Thank you, Please allow me some time to look into this and come back
Stay Safe
XX
Resign your EGO, PRIDE and SUPERIORITY COMPLEX and join BWW
We have seen countless associates finding it difficult to fit due to above issues. You are joining into a new family and you should be in a position and mental state to learn new things
As you learn and adjust correction may come nicely or sometime in unexpected crude ways. You must be able to absorb both with a good attitude.
Do not be prideful to admit the fault and learn. Be humble and listen and learn from everyone. Don’t get hurt and let the EGO get the better of you. If you are getting hurt, then think about yourself carefully and correct. Don’t be sensitive instead be very cheerful when corrected.
Don’t have a superiority complex we are all equal when it comes to work, we have all have the same hands, legs, body and brain. It is up to us on how we use it.
Avoid Work politics
There is nothing more disruptive and damaging to yourself and others than work politics. Work politics is simply talking about being in an unproductive manner.
If someone approaches you with such conversation please avoid and don’t hesitate to inform the HR.
Talk only things which build a person up and avoid any chit chatter which brings a person down
For Interns – University endorsements

Working when Sick
In view of the fact that we work for long hours each day in an enclosed space at the office, it is essential that you indicate, and isolate yourself from the rest of the team when sick.
Coughs and colds spread rapidly in enclosed areas and result in the entire team being affected leading to lost time and productivity.
At the first sign of contagious conditions such as a cough or cold, and if it is essential that you be in office, please be considerate and use the ‘quarantine area’ downstairs and minimise your exposure to the team by using handkerchiefs, face masks etc.
The common cold and cough also have an ‘incubation period’.  You may feel fine after recovery but still liable to spread germs for up to 7 – 10 days.  Continue to use the quarantine area during this time.
Keep a supply of Vitamin C, cough lozenges, etc. with you to use as a preventive measure.  In addition, practice good hygiene; wash your hands often, avoid touching or scratching your eyes with your hands.
Any question you may have please contact your Admin head

Email responses for client requests (internal and external)
March 19, 2011 
 
Communication basics
At BenWorldwide communication is paramount, without communication nothing else exists. Some trades do not require intense and frequent communication such as lawyers but some trades requires intense communication. The service industry specifically service oriented IT falls into the intense type.
Example if you send an email or Whatspp to a lawyer he or she may take days to reply
If you send an Whatsapp to your local shop which is a service industry they may reply in minutes
On call emergency Doctors have to reply in seconds if not someone may loose their lives
Hence the trade you have chosen requires you below discipline
1.	The best and recommended way is is to reply an email within the shortest time possible, usually within minutes to max 10 mins.
2.	There are two types of replies, “Acknowledgements” and “Explanations“. If an Explanation takes time you can send an Acknowledgement.
3.	In most cases you can send both together
4.	Acknowledgement = Usually a quick note to say “I got it”. Like the olden days of walkie talkies. After one person speaks and finishes other person says ROGER THAT. Meaning I heard it.
5.	90% of the emails are usually acknowledgements and can be sent within minutes of getting an email.
6.	Acknowledgement email usually which says “Noted XX, Thank you” are very simple and is a very vital part of BenWorldwide communication.
7.	In Acknowledgement email your email has to be LAST meaning even if the client sends a thank you, your one has to send “Noted” The trail of communication has to send with youExample
Client ” Did you get my ABC folder
You “Yes I did”
Client “Okay thank you for confirming that”
You “Thank you”
Client “Thank you, and have a nice day”
You “not all wishing you a pleasant day as well”
8.	 In this example as you can see the trail always ends with you
9.	It is very odd when someone sends an email during the weekend and one replies on a Monday morning saying Noted (acknowledges) as it shows that person did not check mails during the weekend but just logged in. Avoid this at all cost
10.	What is the recommended frequency for email checking?
(This only an indication and can vary on personal discipline)
	Developers	Designers	Project Management	Marketing
Weekday office hours	Every 60 mins	Every 60 mins	Every 5 mins	Every 5 mins
Weekdays off office hours	Every 2 hours	Every 4 hours	Every 1-2 hours	Every 1-2 hours
Weekends and Holidays	Every 2 hours	Every 4 hours	Every 1-2 hours	Every 1-2 hours
When Sick	Once a day	Once a day	Twice a day	Twice a day
PS Please always remember a client measures our communication during off office hours or weekends, that is where we score points. During office times even if you reply fast the client will not notice but during a weekend if you reply fast the client will be impressed. If you are not able to reply fast during a day or two under special circumstances, you can inform the client prior or even put an out of office.
Going further for any official reqeust from client external or internal we can follow below method.
Dealing with client requests which comes from a phone call, SMS or email is very critical and if neglected can damage a companies reputation and service.
The golden rule should be a reply should to be sent ASAP
There should be 2-3 types of responses in the form of emails which has to go out mandatory;
1-3 for short duration requests and 1-2-3 for long duration requests.
1)      Request acknowledgment – eg:   “ Thank you for the request. We would work around the same and complete in xx time….” this should ideally be sent out within 2-10 mins of email receipts.
2)      Progress report – eg “ Please note the following progress on your project….” (if the request is taking long than usual an update will also be required at this stage on the delivery)
3)      Project completion – “the request has been completed, any further assistance needed please contact us”
When we communicate in the RIGHT MANNER at the RIGHT TIME anyone will appreciate our honesty and our professionalism!
Whatsapp or SMS communication
You can follow the same usual protocols as much as possible communicate with a client on a channel which has been created and avoid private one on communication.
Even if you have to communicate on private channels always email the screen shots or chat trail via email for client and internal ref

WordPress Plugin Update Guidelines
February 24, 2023 
When updating plugins, it is essential to follow the below guidelines to avoid any negative consequences.
1.	It is crucial to inform the team before updating any plugins to ensure that everyone is aware of the changes and any potential issues that may arise.
2.	Always keep a backup of the website before making any updates. This ensures that any unforeseen problems can be addressed by rolling back to a previous version of the site.
3.	If any issues arise after updating plugins, it is important to promptly inform the team so that any necessary fixes can be implemented. Also, keep a notice in BC for future references
By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that plugin updates go smoothly and without issues.

Optimizing a general or WordPress site for SEO
September 26, 2017 
1.	Test website on www.webpagetest.org and find out if there are 404 errors. If so, fix them. In the meantime, check for images, css and JS files taking long loading time.
2.	Test website on Google speed test. Check the suggestions and fix everything possible including image optimization, CSS and JS Minification. If there are render blocking JS files, move them to the footer of the website (make sure this doesn’t affect the functionality of website)
3.	Avoid inline CSS javascripts as much as possible, always use in css file with css selector (Class). Take all possible inline CSS and Javascript to external files and link them.
4.	Apart from this, always include Javascript and CSS in functions.php file using wp_enque_scripts() function instead of including them on header.php and footer.php files. https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/
5.	Remove query strings from the resources.
6.	If the Social media icons, font awesome library etc. are loaded through plugins, deactivate them and implement manually. In the meantime, if there are these type of libraries which are not being used in the site, deactivate them too.
7.	Check for Meta tags and open graph tags, sometimes there can be duplicated Meta tags and OG tags.
8.	Add expire headers and enable Gzip/Deflate compression –  complete file can be found here https://corporate.benworldwide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/htaccess-codes.txt
9.	Combine all possible CSS and Javascript files manually or using a plugin like W3 Total Cache and make sure this doesn’t affect the functionality of the website. (sometimes combining files may break animations, slideshows etc.)
10.	Minfiy HTML (W3 total cache has this features. After test the site completely is a must).
11.	From the server end, enable Opcache – PHP7 needed.

Server Migration
October 19, 2016 
Plan and advice clients about migration at least a week ahead.
1. Disable all CMS (WP) access
Add below block of code to /home/.htaccess in server to block access to backend, but allow BWW IP address only.
<Files "wp-login.php>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 220.247.246.202
</Files>
To manually overwrite this rule for individual sites, the below code has o be added to the .htaccess file of the respective accounts (eg: /home/benworld/.htaccess). This step is NOT recommended unless the client has a very URGENT update to be done while (or before ) migration.
<Files "wp-login.php>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Files>
2. Disable Magento shopping carts
Add maintenance.flag file in webroot and change .htaccess to show temporary html maintenance page
3. Block and disable booking engines and other systems
Block both frontend & backend of all booking engines, reservation systems, invoice systems, etc. before migration. This step has to be taken before migration, in order to prevent data loss.
In CakePHP, add a HTML index page in the webroot
4. Commence transfer of accounts to new server
Make sure no errors occur during migration. If any error occur, attempt to re-transfer that account(s) again.
5. Assign IP addresses accordingly
It is always better to split IP addresses among the list of accounts
6. Change IP addresses for hostnames created for Name servers
This need to be done from the domain registrar for the respective domain used for NS records
7. Test random websites by changing your local host file to the new IP address
This way you can verify that the sites are working perfectly fine after the client has changed the DNS.
8. Inform clients to update the respective DNS record(s)
9. Test ALL websites manually
After each client confirms the DNS has been changed, check if the propagation has been completed globally.
This can be checked using below tools
www.whatsmydns.net
mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx
dns.freebnc.co.uk (Bulk DNS check – 150 at-a-time)
If DNS propagation is completed, TEST the website thoroughly.
You can test HTTP status as a bulk using the below site:
httpstatus.io
The IP addresses of the server that we use, need to have PTR records set. This has to be done by the Hosting provider. The PTR record can be any subdomain of the primary hostname domain.
eg: if primary hostname is server.bww.com PTR for other IP addresses could be abc.bww.com or xyz.bww.com, etc.

Moving from HTTP to HTTPS
April 19, 2016 
Configuring WordPress for SSL/HTTPS
 
Links in WordPress (such as image attachments, themes CSS and JavaScript files) are relative to the install URL.
To change WordPress from HTTP to HTTPS, the install URL must changed from say http://designmodo.com to https://designmodo.com.
Login to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to Settings > General.
Ensure that the WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) are https. If not, add S after http to make https and save it.
WordPress General Settings
To easily enable (and enforce) WordPress administration over SSL, the constant FORCE_SSL_ADMIN should be set to true in your site’s wp-config.php file to force all logins and all admin sessions to happen over SSL.
define(‘FORCE_SSL_ADMIN’, true);
The constant FORCE_SSL_ADMIN can be set to true to force all logins and all admin sessions to happen over SSL.
If your WordPress site uses a content delivery network (CDN) to serve its components (images, JavaScript, CSS style sheet), ensure the URLs are all https:// otherwise your website will be deem insecure by the web browser.
NOTE: A Find & Replace of non-SSL URLs with new SSL URL is always recommended.
What’s Next?
Now that we’ve successfully moved WordPress to HTTPS, we still need to do two more things — set up a 301 permanent redirect and inform Google of the URL change.
To setup a 301 permanent redirect, FTP/SFTP to your server and add the code below at the top of WordPress’ .htaccess file.
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yoursite.com 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.yoursite.com 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.yoursite.com/$1 
Change every instance of yoursite.com to your WordPress URL.
To inform Google about the change in URL, re-add your WordPress site to Google webmaster tool (but this time with https://) and follow this this guide to let Google know about the change of URL.
You can check your SSL website status using Qualys SSL Labs.

2CO – Overseas payment collection method
April 17, 2023 
What is 2co? 
2Checkout (2CO) is an online payment processing service that allows businesses to accept payments from customers worldwide.
https://secure.2checkout.com/cpanel/logon.php
Why are we using 2co?
We usually use 2co for a few clients who cannot do direct USD transfers via bank.
Disadvantage of receiving the payment via 2co?
2CO charges higher fees compared to some other payment processors, especially for smaller transactions.
IMPORTANT FEE TRANSACTIONS
Every Payment transacted via 2Checkout needs to IMPORTANTLY reflect 2 Additions: 1. Transfer Fee: 15 USD & 2. IPG Fee: 10% Added to the Annual Fee.
The BWW Invoice will reflect the break up of the above transactions however when creating a PAYLINK in 2CheckOut Mention only the TOTAL PAYABLE AMOUNT (which will include the Annual Fee + 10% IPG Fee + 15 USD Transfer Fee.)
Example:
1.	Annual Host Fee for ABC : 200 USD
2.	Add 10% IPG Fee = 220 USD
3.	Add 15 USD Transfer Fee = 235 USD
4.	Total Payable = 235 USD (This is the amount that needs to be reflected in the 2checkout Paylink)
 
How to create a payment link?
1.	Check on ” Generate links ” on the menu
 
2. Select CONVERT PLUS
 
3. SCROLL DOWN AND SELECT “ONE-STEP CHECKOUT”
 
4. SELECT DYNAMIC PRODUCTS ; CURRENCY – USD
 
TYPE – Select DIGITAL PRODUCT
NAME – Enter the Transaction/Client/Billing Year Details Eg: Annual Host Fee for ABC 2023 – 2024
QUANTITY – Enter ‘1’
PRICE – Enter “Total Payable Amount” Eg: 235 USD
Example Reference 
 
 
 
3. Go to additional settings and select ” one column, with payment buttons ”
 
4.Click on ” generate link ”
 
5. You can copy the link, test it and send the URL to the client with your invoice email.

DRAFT EMAIL FOR LOW BUDGET CLIENTS
July 9, 2021 
Dear XX,
We thank you & value your inquiry on our services.
Unfortunately there seems to be a mismatch with the project budget and the actual deliverables. We thought its best to highlight this note at this very juncture so that there are no misunderstandings in the event you still wish to pursue this inquiry with our team.
We have been in this business close to 15+ years and it is always difficult to match project outcome & expectations however we can do justice to both when we have a clear indication on the project budget. It helps us draw a line between what is expected and what can actually be delivered.
In your scenario we don’t see the project deliverables & budget aligning themselves in the same direction. We need to have clear parameters set for the project from the get go so that there is no misunderstandings.
When we handle Budgeted Projects please note our service parameters also change:
Example:
•	Projects starts only once the XX payment is made in full.
•	No Refunds provided under any condition
•	We go in directly for a Design Template with just one round of design change – Client can pay more and get more changes if he needs to
•	The number of zoom calls or meetings for the entire project will be limited to only 2
The price of a web design project is a  set amount which is done and over with however the value that the website (work we do) brings back to your business definitely outweighs the price invested. Sadly, this is often overlooked by most businesses .
On the same note we would like you to re-consider & discuss with your team on the project budget and give our team clear deliverables which can do justice to both sides.
Please consider and confirm to proceed
•	Please re-word the email based on client 
•	The draft is to give you an idea of what needs to be in an email not to just copy paste.
•	If it is for sensitive leads please run it via SupportLead 
 
 
 
Draft for low hours and refused to renew client
January 13, 2020 
Dear XXX ,
As given to understand in your email OR phone conversation OR text message, you do not wish to renew the Maintenance Package for XYZ Website OR ABC IPG OR XYZ Booking Engine.
We understand your decision and will not remind you hereafter however as your online service partner we find it imperative to inform you that you are presently hosting a critical Payment Gateway OR online Shop Or Booking Engine with us and these are systems which can collapse without any notifications. 

For example : If the IPG has some changes due to the bank rules or new %age mark ups and it has to be done immediately , and if the hours pending is not sufficient to complete the task please be informed that no matter how critical or urgent the situation will be, our support team will NOT assist your account and hence there will be NO work on the request. 
This will be the same even if you send an email at that moment stating that you are ready to purchase or renew the package. As clearly finance wont release the account unless the payment for the same gets duly credited. 
All this back and forth of communication & approvals will simply detain the team from working on the task and combat the issue impact to your business online. 
We are citing the situation as it will be so that you are well informed from all sides and make the decision accordingly. As simple as the task may sound solutions like booking engine or invoicing systems needs at least 15 – 20 Hours of maintenance hours even for basic disruptive type issues because it doesn’t just stop at task completion we have to do tests to ensure its functioning well and only then we close the task.
We hope and trust you understand the seriousness.  Please understand this email is not in any form to intimate you or your business but solely with a purpose to make you aware of the consequences that can/may occur of Non-Renewal.
We are more than glad to speak with you if needed or you can email us for any clarifications.
Thank you

Here are a few questions that will help us map out our SEO strategy:
1.	Could you share the URL of your current website? This will allow me to conduct an initial review and assess the current SEO setup.
2.	How would you describe the priority of SEO for your business compared to other marketing efforts you might be engaged in?
3.	What are the main objectives you wish to achieve through SEO? (e.g., increasing traffic, improving search rankings, generating leads, etc.)
4.	Are there any specific aspects of your business or industry that you think are vital to be prominently featured in search results?
5.	Have you identified any keywords or phrases that you believe your potential customers might use to search for your services or products?
6.	How do you measure success for your business online, and are there any particular goals you have in mind for the short term and long term?
7.	Are there any specific challenges you’ve faced with your website’s visibility or search performance in the past?
8.	Do you have any preferences or concerns regarding the content on your website that you would like to discuss?
Rest assured, there’s no need for technical expertise on your part—that’s what I’m here for. Your insights and experiences are invaluable as they stand, and together we’ll translate them into a robust SEO strategy.
Your responses will guide the development of a customized SEO plan designed to enhance your visibility in search engines and connect with your target audience effectively.

Please note this is a Sample Email and the contents can be modified as per the situation requirement. Final Email needs To Be APPROVED by Support.Lead
Dear ,
We appreciate the opportunity to work with you on . However, we wanted to bring to your attention that the budget you have proposed for this project is significantly lower than our standard pricing.
We understand that budget constraints can be a challenge, and we are committed to finding ways to work within our clients’ budgets whenever possible. That being said, we want to be upfront and transparent about what you can expect from us given the budget you have provided.
While we are happy to take on this project, it is important to note that we will need to make some concessions in order to stay within your budget. This may mean that certain aspects of the project may not be as comprehensive as they would be under normal circumstances.
We want to ensure that you are aware of the limitations that come with a reduced budget and that your expectations are appropriately set. We will still deliver the highest quality work possible within the constraints we are given, but we cannot guarantee the same level of detail and attention that we would be able to provide at our regular pricing.
If you have any questions or concerns about this, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are committed to transparency and open communication and want to ensure that we are on the same page as we move forward with this project.
Thank you for your understanding and for entrusting us with your project.
Best regards,

Price Increase in Web Hosting – Email Reply
February 15, 2021 
Dear XX,
We understand that you don’t feel justified to see a price increase year on year for the Hosting Services that you pay for.
However %age increases are nominal as it is for the full year. Please note your onetime fee of Rs/USD 000.00 amounts to only 00.00 USD per day for which there is a lot of background work that goes on from our side which often is unnoticed or not accounted for as explained further in this email.
Our Sales team generally informs the client of the below services in general for Hosting which is by default provided for any client :
Server Hosting Management
Server uptime assurance
Server security and hardening
Bandwidth monitoring and control
Error management and breakdown service
Trouble shooting
Analytics set up and monitoring
Malware scans
Malware cleans up
DDOS attack monitor and mitigate
Firewall Monitoring
IP Hulk Blocks
Admin access monitor and block
Port checks for suspicious usage
24X7 hotline for any kind of issues you face
The online world has been seeing a major threat rise in the last 12 months as outlined in the SECURITY BRIEF EU link https://securitybrief.eu/story/check-point-report-highlights-latest-cyber-threats-worldwide
The amount of new Malware Created Every Year has increased in a huge percentage. Considering all the factors we have to take extra protective measures from ClientName server side.
BWW servers are strategically located across the United States, to provide our clients with the highest level of hosting service, with both physical and cyber security systems
We have a team in house seated in our Colombo office that is reachable in case of any emergencies.
To make sure your website is accessible around the clock our in house BWW team works on the reliability of each and every server we deploy.
We make sure to have  daily, weekly and monthly courtesy backups and are equipped with the most advanced hosting control panel for you  to have full control over the content of your site.
All the above accounts for resources time utilization which cannot be constant and changes time on time based on factors like technology change ; server upgrades etc
In conclusion we’d like to add that scalability of these services offered  isn’t an easy concept to explain or document because it goes far beyond just hosting a website and charging the client annuals.
Trust our email helps address your concerns reasonably well.
We thank you in advance for your understanding & you will cooperate and help in closing the outstanding at your best convenience.

Annual reduction request email
Dear XXX
We understand your concerns on the fee.
Let me explain the process which takes place behind the scenes and that will help you understand the cost factors.
Right now you pay XX which turns out to be YY per day
For this amount we do the following services;
1.	We upgrade the CMS continuously from a server level
2.	Our server engineers have to check the security of the systems on a daily basis
3.	Daily there are thousands of attack which takes place to the server and your site, we have to protect the site from these attacks
4.	We have to provide security to the server where you site is hosted in terms of firewalls, IP Blocks and server hardening
5.	We provided you hosting for 365 days, which is 8760 hours of hosting
6.	In case of a infections we have to clean the site within 24 hours and de list as needed from all the search engines
7.	We provide 24 X 7 support – Any problems you face you enjoy the services of calling or emailing us and we attend to your services 365 days
8.	Our agents are available to troubleshoot any issue day or night which you may have with regards to the site
For less than YY a day we think this is more than a fair amount.
Yes there maybe much cheaper services out there. But unfortunately based on the quality services we provide we have given you the very best pricing.
In the event you want to select another service provider, the codes with the CD will be burnt and handed over. We don’t undertake any guarantees during and after transfers.
The online world is changing by the day and our servers and services also is being upgraded continuously to keep up to the standards globally. As such these price may increase in the future, we cannot assure to keep at this level always. Rest assured if you choose to remain with us we will inform you of such increases.
Thank you

Client not going in for revamp
Hi xx,
I hope this email finds you keeping well.
Just wanted to drop you a note on the xxx website – I fully understand that you maybe not be able to proceed with the revamp due to various business reasons which is understandable by us. are not interested in revamping the site which is okay by us.
Because despite several follow ups and with our last meeting where we spent time & made you understand why the revamp is necessary.
I have also attached the Mobile stats for your website which shows a Bounce Rate of  almost xx% combined for tablet and mobile devices which huge in terms of the number of potential visitors you are losing.
Nonetheless the decision is purely yours because as your web development partner – we can only suggest and make you aware and if you wish not to go ahead we fully understand.
However it is our duty to inform you that a revamp is highly needed as the current one was developed quite some time and the technologies/servers/languages all have changed and keeping in the current state can make the site have errors and unforeseen behaviors. Therefore you should not say to us that we did not pre inform you about the same.
Trust the same can be also referenced so that in future if you face any such website related issues we share an understanding that it was explained to you and the occurrences are a result of inaction.
Thank you for the understanding
Kind Regards,
xxx
Client not responding to proposal (tough version)
Dear XXX,
I am writing this email with reluctance. As you know an email was sent and despite several reminders there has been no response.
I understand for various reasons you may have decided to nullify our proposal or put in hold or even maybe too busy to look into it for now.
It would be much appreciated if  you can simple reply informing if:
1/If you have decided not to go ahead with us
2/ If you have chosen us for the project but need more time to review all aspects
3/ Or any other reason as required
A considerable expense of my time has been put for your lead, meetings and presentations. You are in no obligation to confirm any proposal but all I require is a simple email with some direction so that I can close off or file away the request.
This will help me organize my work and appropriate file away the project inquiry
Look forward to your reply
Thanks
CCCC
Client not responding to proposal (soft version)
Dear XXXX,
We hope this email finds you doing well. Its been a while that we have been following up on the project discussion and haven’t heard back from you.
Hence we regrettably have to assume you’ve gone in a different direction or the project priorities have changed.
If this the case please let me know so that I can close the matter up from my side from following up and tracking your inquiry.
Thank you
Kind Regards,
vvv

Email draft to send for clients who send bulk emails
July 19, 2023 
There are two types of receivers
One type of client who we need to be strict.
Dear ,
Greetings from BenWorldwide!
We have received notification from our email server support team regarding the usage of some of your email accounts for sending bulk emails (i.e., more than 10 recipients in a single email). We wish to bring to your attention that this practice violates the Fair Usage Policy (FUP), potentially resulting in a negative impact on your domain’s reputation and leading to its classification as spam, consequently affecting email deliverability. Therefore, we kindly request you to instruct your team not to engage in sending bulk emails.
Thank you
Type two clients who we need to carefully tackle so this is a soft version
Dear ,
Greetings from BenWorldwide!
We have received a notification from our email server support team regarding the usage of some of your email accounts for sending bulk emails (i.e., multiple recipients in a single email).
Generally, any email provider only supports regular business transactional email. It means there is a thread going back and forth. When a marketing email is sent to multiple users in one go it is considered as a Bulk email.
When this is done most users click and mark as Spam and which black lists your IP and the server, potentially resulting in a negative impact on your domain’s reputation and consequently affecting email deliverability.
Therefore, we kindly request you to instruct your team not to do this.
This also goes against the Fair Usage Policy (FUP). If you want to send bulk emails we can suggest alternate suggestions to send newsletters which are professional and these servers handle bulk emails in a professional manner.
Thank You
Confirmation before we give the site to external host
November 25, 2021 
Dear XXX,
Good Afternoon !
As per your email, we noted that you would like to host the site internally on your server.
We want to inform few points as your tech partner before we move the website to your team
As you are an important client we want to avoid any misunderstands, we have our server fully managed for any issues we have partnered with vendors who can jump in 24X7 to our server and fix and look into any issues. These partners are only contracted to look after BWW Servers as such;
1. Once we send the final web files and access, BWW will not be responsible for any issues occurring on the website.
2. Only the files and access will be given to the XX team and the XX team has to launch it live internally. BWW will be able to advise for anything but we are unable to log in to troubleshoot
3. BWW does not support/maintain externally hosted websites due to technical restrictions. Any changes to the website in the future should be attended by the XX team
Please confirm the above points and we will pass you the web files by tomorrow
Thank you

Plug in upgrade client complaining draft
June 4, 2020 
Dear XX
With reference to the recent charge of XX we understands your frustration, if you check with a few other IT gurus they may even advise this is a very simple task
Let us explain more in detail;
•	Your site is made up of plug ins, usually 15-30 or more
•	These plugin’s work collectively to form a site
•	Usually over time these plugs in degrade (ceased to top working or never versions come up)
•	The plug in upgrades itself is a simple click of a button function. (this is where the misunderstanding occurs)
•	The issue is that when the plug in upgraded your theme stops working
•	In some if the plug has ceased to function we need to find a new plugin
•	That is why we have to upgrade each (one by one) plugin and check the front end and tweak the theme
•	If there are 15 plugins this process can take 5-8 hours, if there are 30 plugs in it can 12 to 14 hours
•	In some cases the site completely crashes in these instances we have to restore the full site and start the process all over again, each restoration can take 1 hour or more.
•	End of the day it usually takes much more than we have quoted
As you can see the cost is not purely for the plug in’s upgrade, it is for the entire process
We are doing everything to keep your site safe. End of the a hack can cost you much more in terms of reputation and opportunity than what we quoted.
I hope you understand our side of the situation
We thank you for everything
Rgds

External hosting client sending changes or assistance
Dear XXXX
Our operational team has mentioned prior that we cannot troubleshoot and maintain externally hosted websites.
Whilst we value you as an important client we can only troubleshoot internally hosted sites. The reasons for that is that we have multiple tools to solve any issues fairly fast and efficiently. Moreover, we have spent considerable amounts on the tech infrastructure which includes server techs to jump in any time we cannot solve something.
Therefore, in the future we will not be able to assist like below, I am sending this now to avoid any kind of miscommunications.
Our Marketing has packages for hosting with BWW and you we move you into our server without any downtime if needed.
Thank you

Support Communication & email drafts
February 20, 2017 
Key factors to consider when replying to support tickets
Personalisation
•	Greeting –  Good Morning! Or appropriate greeting.
•	Ask how they are doing – “Hope you are doing well?”, “How are you?”
Be detailed about your reply
•	Explain the history, what has happened etc. for an example below reply could be like this;
“As I have informed earlier we’ve wrote to Zoho about the matter. Finally they have replied saying that they have done some configuration from their end and now the emails should work fine.
Can you please check and confirm me on the same?”
Closure
•	End the mail with if required any response requesting that or welcome them to if there is any other issues and with a nice greeting.
Eg: “should there be any queries, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
Have a nice day a head.” (Or based on the time greet, e.g.: Have nice evening, have nice weekend. Etc.)
When  client requests for free of charge service to fix bugs (email template):
Dear XXX,
As you know this was working fine since we launched the project. Overtime your sites as any other website goes through changes, in terms of codes, plugs in etc, the net environment which is operates also goes through changes example server operating systems and browser versions and upgrades. Nothing will freeze and remain the same. Overtime when these changes happens usually within a year small upkeeps are needed to keep the site working fine. These are not errors as it was working fine before. Your site is nearly 3 years old. In such instance you have three choices
1) Go in for a fresh revamp
2) Ignore the issue usually if it’s minor
3) Or modify the site to keep the latest standard for the particular issue
In case of point 3 there will be a cost
I hope this explain everything
Issue with analytics missing (email template):
Dear XX
Applogies for the delay we were going into details on this, we have fixed the matter and now you should see the traffic data. The Google tags were not getting captured and we have corrected this.

Website Migration
November 9, 2016 
The below instructions are to transfer a website from one location to the other. This applies if you need to clone a website to a different domain or if you are transferring a Beta site to the live server.
In the below instructions,
“Source” is referred to the location / website which you need to move / copy.
“Destination” is referred to the new location / website where you need to move the current site to
Method I : Using cPanel Remote Backup Method
I) Login to the cPanel of the source
eg: http://www.example.com/cpanel or http://www.example.com:2082
II) Go to ‘File Manager‘ and ensure any unnecessary backup files are removed.
III) Go to ‘Backup Wizard‘ and select ‘Backup‘, then select ‘Full Backup‘
IV) For Backup Destination, choose ‘Remote FTP Server‘
V) Enter your email address to receive the backup log via email
VI) Enter the details
Remote Server – Destination URI / IP address of server
Remote User – Destination account username
Remote Password – Destination account password
Port – 21
Remote Dir – /public_html
VII) Click ‘Generate Backup‘
Once the full backup has been transferred to your destination, you will receive an email to the address specified in (V) above. Check the log to see if any errors have occurred. If not, see step (IX).
VIII) Download MySQL Database(s) of Source using cPanel ‘Backup‘ or ‘phpMyAdmin‘ or ‘Migrate DB‘ plugin via WP backend (for WP sites).
Ensure that the Site URL has been changed in the downloaded Database dump.
IX) Login to the Destination account cPanel
X) Go to File Manager and Extract the transferred backup file (backup-{BACKUP_DATE_TIME}_{USERNAME}.tar.gz) inside public_html
The file will be extracted into a folder by its own name.
The folder will contain the entire set of files of that user account.
XI) After extracting, the website files will be located in backup-xxxx-xx-xx-xxxx_username/homedir/public_html
You may move all these files into your new public_html (Drag-and-drop using cPanel File manager.
Download the SQL file from backup-xxxx-xx-xx-xxxx_username/mysql/
(If not downloaded from Source account)
XII) In cPanel Dashboard, go to ‘MySQL Database Wizard‘ and create the new Database and Database User (Note down the DB Name, User name, & Password)
XIII) Go to ‘phpMyAdmin’ and Select the new Database created
XIV) Import the downloaded database to the new account’s Database.
XV) Update the Database configuration details in ‘wp-config.php’ in your new webroot.
XVI) Holaaaa!!! Your website should now work on the new server.
 
Method II : Using Shell access (SSH)
Ensure both accounts (source and destination) have Shell access enabled. If not please contact the server administrator and get it enabled.
Login to one of the accounts via SSH using the Linux Terminal or PuTTY (for Windows)
(Reference: https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204404604/using-ssh-in-putty-) 
Use either (transfer TO or transfer FROM) of the commands given in the SSH tutorial of this blog.
It is better to first compress the files and then transfer one file to the new server(account).
Database also can be transferred via SSH using mysqldump command, but it is better to use Plugin method for WP sites.
 
Method III : Manual (Download & Upload)
Compress and download the ‘wp-content’ folder via cPanel or FTP.
Also download the wp-config if it is already configured for the Beta site or Localhost
Download the Database for the site(s) via phpmyAdmin or WP Migrate DB (Recommended for WP sites)

Preparing a report for Website Analysis and Optimization for Enhanced Conversion
July 21, 2023 
Dear Associate,
At BenWorldwide as a UI/UX and Web Psychology expert, we need to share some insights on how to study any website to ensure its design, strategy, images, and text are optimized for maximum conversion.
1.	User-Centric Approach: Begin by understanding our target audience and their needs. Analyze user behaviour, preferences, and pain points to align the website’s flow and direction with their expectations. Conduct user surveys, interviews, and usability testing to gain valuable insights.
2.	Clear and Purposeful Design: Assess the website’s visual elements and ensure they contribute to a coherent and intuitive user experience. Maintain consistency in colours, fonts, and imagery to establish brand identity. Use whitespace effectively to reduce clutter and guide users’ attention to essential elements.
3.	Conversion-Focused Content: Analyze the website’s content to ensure it aligns with the user’s journey and supports their decision-making process. Each piece of content should have a clear purpose, whether it’s informing, educating, or persuading users to take action.
4.	Information Hierarchy: Review the website’s structure and information hierarchy to create a smooth flow from the homepage to conversion points. Organize content logically, prioritize key information, and lead users naturally towards our desired goals.
5.	Intuitive Navigation: Check the navigation system for simplicity and ease of use. Ensure users can find what they need without confusion or frustration. Implement clear calls-to-action (CTAs) that stand out and prompt users to take the desired actions.
6.	Visual Cues and Psychology: Use visual cues strategically to guide users’ attention towards conversion elements. Employ psychological principles such as scarcity, urgency, and social proof to influence users positively.
7.	Responsive and Fast-loading: Ensure the website is responsive and functions flawlessly across various devices and screen sizes. Optimize page loading speed to minimize bounce rates and enhance the overall user experience.
8.	A/B Testing: Implement A/B testing to compare design elements, copy variations, and CTAs. Use data-driven insights to refine the website continuously and improve conversion rates.
9.	Analytical Tools: Utilize web analytics tools like Google Analytics to track user behaviour, conversion funnels, and areas for improvement. Regularly monitor data to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.
10.	Continuous Improvement: Website optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly review user feedback, conduct usability audits, and stay updated with industry best practices to ensure the website remains effective and relevant.
By following these steps, we can create a purposeful and conversion-oriented website report that maximizes user engagement and drives desired actions.
Design Stage : IMP Notes.
May 11, 2023 
Is it okay to push the client for the Design confirmation?
YES & NO 
You need to weigh the situation of the Project/AnyPaymentsLinked/Criticality of Project Business and other such factors before you decide your decision. Always make sure to consult Support.Lead@bww.one & a Senior before you convey the decision to the client.
If the answer is Yes ..
1.	Send a Polite but Clear Email Stating the Background of the Situation and how the delay in approvals can impact the Project Overall.
2.	Highlight Time Restrictions if any due to delay/s.
3.	Politely Create a WA Group and make sure to send a reminder there also.
If the answer is a No
1.	Make sure to get support.lead@bww.one approval via email.
2.	Once you get a “No Need to FollowUp” approval send an email internally to the team for records and be silent thereafter.
Situations that can Arise in the Design Stage of the Project 
1.	The client has been Silent for a Month and Now Wants the Design Changes & Project to be delivered in 2 Weeks!!!
•	Calmly first understand the Client’s side of the situation – Why was he silent and why the sudden urgency?
•	Communicate this with the team. Get their feedback and then plan an action.
•	Do a reality check and see if you have enough resources in hand to deliver as per what the client wants or if you need to revise the project schedule.
•	Always remember to check with support.lead@bww.one if there will be any late restart fee before committing or activating the project design.
2. Client Complains the Design is Not Good.
•	Check with Marketing Team on the same and if the project budget is in line with what the design delivered is.
•	Based on that you can action certain minor improvements or modifications but all these plan of action needs to be formally approved by support.lead@bww.one.
3. Client Has a History of Making Delays but puts the Blame on Us.
•	Make sure you have all client emails and conversations via calls or messages are well recorded via emails or messages.
•	Always be professional and have proof of work and delays from the client side.
•	Never do things to aggravate the Client because sometimes being patient and not defensive can help in sustaining a good business relationship.
•	Act wisely and with caution & do not let the situation spin out of control.
4. Client repeatedly gives change on change & is indecisive.
•	Always have a plan of action for such clients and make it appear that any and every change how so ever small involves time and resource allocation.
•	Inform the Client Of Project Commitments Negotiated at the Marketing Stage after you consult Marketing & Support.Lead.
•	Handle each situation case by case and if need be make sure to charge the client extra so that they are aware that changes also can cost.
Important Disclaimers that Need to be Sent with ANY DESIGN EMAIL 
**Please Note: We would like to clarify that the final confirmation of the design is Not Directly linked to the commencement of the development or the final launch of the project. Several aspects such as planning of time, resources, availability, and internal team checks need to be factored in. We would like to emphasize that the start of project development and the final delivery cannot be hastened or rushed, as these are critical and time-consuming processes that cannot be expedited. **
*Please be advised that a delay in the delivery of content and images may have an impact on the development timeline. Also, we will not start development until we receive all the content and images.*
P.S. 
These are protocols that are mentioned in general situations however please be discreet and handle each client by client – Case by Case.
Always make sure to cite your Plan of Action before initiating it externally to the client and have it Approved by SupportLead. 
Cross Linking Strategy
April 20, 2023 
What is Cross-linking strategy? 
•	Cross-linking strategy is a marketing approach that involves linking related products or services to encourage customers to purchase more.
•	This strategy can be applied in various ways, such as through cross-selling or upselling.
•	Cross-selling is the practice of recommending a related product to a customer who is already purchasing a product.
Ex: if a customer buys a camera, a retailer may suggest buying a memory card or a camera case.
We can use the same strategy on a product page / a hotel /room page
 
If you see the above screenshot of a website, at the bottom of the inner page they have suggested two areas
1.	Other links
2.	What is next
If you think as a normal user reading the vision and mission of a company, once you have completed reading you might get lost on what to do or you will simply exit the web page and do something else. But in such cases if you have other links and what is next links the users will be retained on the website some more time and they might like the business model and give you a business as well.
Apart from the bottom links, if you can see on the side there is a section called key takeaways which will have the summary of the page content for the ease of the user reading it.
Advantages of using cross-linking strategy 
•	Businesses can increase revenue by encouraging customers to purchase additional products or services.
•	It also helps to build customer loyalty by providing customers with a more comprehensive and convenient shopping experience.

IMP – When using a theme for design
November 10, 2022 
Hi PM,
When the website is designed by using a theme, please make sure to stick with the theme elements and not customize it based on the client’s requirements.
Eg: If a slider is having only 4 blocks on the theme, make sure to only add 4 . If we go to increase the blocks that will become a hassle in the development stage. It will be very time-consuming and the project will be a loss.
At the design stage itself, if you feel that the theme is not compatible with the client’s requirement always go back to the designer/team and sort it out at that point
Conclusion: The theme should be used just as the theme without any extra elements
Thank you

Core Revamp Procedure – Marketing or Support Team
Email draft to inform the client why a core revamp is needed
 
 
—————————————————————————————————————-
Dear XXX,
Good Afternoon!
We hope this email finds you & all at ABC team doing well!
This email is to bring to your URGENT ATTENTION – the need for an URGENT CORE REVAMP of ABC website.
Your website was developed almost way back and since then technology has changed in ways of coding standards the introduction of new devices and the latest browser updates. In such a scenario running the site on an outdated platform can pose a lot of risks. It is imperative that we bring to your attention that your website needs to go in for an URGENT CORE REVAMP.
FAQ
1.	What is a CORE REVAMP?
•	We can maintain the same design but from the code level, we will upgrade the website infrastructure to the latest tech, tighten the security, upgrade plugins, re-install SSL etc…
2.	 Why This Is Very Important?
•	To avoid sudden site crashes OR malicious virus attacks due to the outdated platform.
•	To improve your website health.
3.	What will happen if we do not do a CORE REVAMP?
•	Website recovery is absolutely not possible.
•	The next step will be to re-do the Design and Development of the website starting from the very beginning.
4.	Can I continue without this?
•	Yes, but it is very very risky and please don’t request us to help if things go wrong.
5.	Will my site get affected if I choose not to proceed?
•	Yes in 2022 we will be installing the new firewall which will lock out any suspicious logins and if the site’s core is older the security levels will be auto-generated as alert red.
6.	Can I proceed with a Revamp instead of a CORE REVAMP?
•	Yes, can proceed. We can start the project from scratch. We can re-design and develop the entire website according to a new web strategy.
In Summary, CORE REVAMP is very important to secure the site against external threats and the technology has undergone a considerable improvement since the creation of the website along with the number of cyber security.
As your online service partner, we find it our duty to inform you about the current website status and we strongly recommend you do at least CORE REVAMP urgently to avoid any inconvenience down the road.
Thank you for your understanding and please let us know your decision on OR before XX / XX / XXXX.
Best Regards,
XXX.

3.	After the backup was stored in a secure place then we automated and checked on what are the broken links
4.	Internal checkup for existing website files and plugins was completed
5.	The team checked on the CMS / PHP version and the Server OS versions
6.	The WordPress plugins used for functions were checked and updated.
7.	Once a plugin was checked the team checked on the front end and if all was okay the other plugin was updated.
8.	Upgraded the website infrastructure

16.	Migrated the files to the Live server
17.	Did a full site checkup —>. Here we checked all the call-to-action buttons, and contact forms to make sure all are working fine.
As the next step, it is essential you check site pages one by one and check any forms to ensure you are getting the inquiry.

Best Regards,
XXX

WordPress Core Revamp Procedure – Developers
 
Hi Developers,
Below is the procedure you must follow If you are assigned to a core revamp project. If any doubts you can always reach a Senior Developer for further details.
1. Get the site logins (cPanel/WP) from Lahiru or Rajith if not added to the BC
2. Keep a full site backup (Files/Database)
3. Login and go through the site and check for the broken site functions, Note down if any issues exist
4. Check the server’s PHP and MySQL versions
5. Clone the site to the localhost with the same PHP/MySQL versions
6. Update the WordPress Version
7. Update the plugins one by one. Start with the simple plugins first. Check for the plugin functionality once update each one
8. Get the Paid plugin files from Lahiru if needed. (ex: Visual composer, Slider Revolution, etc)
9. NEVER UPDATE THE THEME
10. Compare the Localhost with the Live site and confirm all are working (Desktop/Mobile)
11. “Migrate the files to the Live server” or “Perform points 6-8 again in the live server”. Do as suitable since sometimes it is faster to do the updates rather than migrate again. Depends on the situation and complexity.
12. Setup SSL if not configured already
13. Check the Wordfence settings and optimize the firewall again. (Go through the Wordfence tutorial added to Basecamp)
13. Do a full site checkup

CONTENT GATHERING /ENTERING ASPECT + IMAGES
August 2, 2021 
•	CONTENT GATHERING /ENTERING ASPECT + IMAGES
When a PM receives a Project he/she gets a Project Scope.
In the Project Scope it is clearing defined on the number of pages that needs to be entered by BWW Team.
In case it is NOT MENTIONED it is the duty of the assigned PM to check back with the Sales Team.
In general the Pages to be Entered by BWW will always be a standard of 10Pages
So when the Project is running and the PM needs to collect/gather the data for the Project from the Client he/she needs to – IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL PAGES that need Content Entering ; ENSURE that CONTENT FOR ALL THOSE PAGES ARE RECEIVED ; Complete the BETA LINK and SEND CLIENT to ENTER THE REMAINDER.
For example – If a Project is estimated to have 30 Pages and we have agreed to enter only 10pages ; the assigned PM needs to check which 10 Pages are critical ; gather contents for those pages ; complete the development ; inform Accounts on balance ; clear balance then send the admin logins for client to enter balance content. 
 
IMAGES – Whatever images you receive during the development will be uploaded we don’t wait or waste time on this.
 
 
NO NEED of QUICK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ** Pls note instances can vary so if unsure always check back
 
•	Problematic Clients (Clients who forever find fault in everything you do) – No need to send an ASAP reply saying Noted will get back .. Take time and maybe after some time analyze check and you can send the reply.
 
•	Emails that are sent with Payment Conflicts 
 
•	Legal Issue Emails 
 
QUICK ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ** Pls note instances can vary so if unsure always check back
 
A Client with whom BWW Foresees good furtherance in business.
 
When it could be the MD of a Company or a CEO of a certain project.
 
QUICK PROJECT UPDATE SUMMARY v/s DETAILED EMAILS = PAYMENTS
 
Whenever there is an instance of Balance Payment , the first thing the client does is to complain or bring up if that the work is not completed.
 
In such scenarios remember to always highlight the project doings in quick summary updates and when things calm down go into the details; even when working on weekends for any project – always be smart to send Weekend emails to clients showing them that hey look we worked on your project on the weekend also ..
End of the day it becomes the PM’s aim to ensure that all is done to collect the balance payment on time in cases of which there is a delay or difficulty. Coordinate and work very closely with Sales Team & Support accordingly.

Informing Client on Limited WhatsApp
May 20, 2021 
Dear XXX,
In reference to ongoing  operational communication it is recommended that we stay with emails as there are number of stakeholders internally and externally that can be well informed & helps in more efficient project coordination and references. As there are multiple people working and all of them are not in this group.
Therefore please don’t misunderstand if I don’t instantly respond to WhatsApp but rest assured I will send the email reply
We can keep this channel for any emergencies
Thank you

Project History Emails – Draft
May 11, 2021 
This draft is just to give the PM an idea of how to draft the email.
This can be used in instances when the project is getting dragged or going beyond estimated hours or constant changes or sudden blame game from client side.
Prepare the draft as per your project situation with relevant dates.
Get it approved from Sales Team & Final Approval from SupportLead
EMAIL DRAFT MESSAGE FOR REFERNCE ONLY
Dear Mr. XXX , 
We hope this email finds you keeping well.
We understand, that through the project workings there have been certain miscommunications that have risen which puts a disparity between expectations and actuals of the project. Hence we have taken time and wish to give the full scenario correctly.
As a kind request please do not dismiss the email as our intentions to state the below is so that there is more focus on “what needs to done” as opposed to “what can be done”
We are a bit displeased with the progress of the project and responsiveness in terms of support that we have received from your team (**name of the client). Hence we wish to give a clear timeline of how things have spanned out
Workings of the Project History
On 2nd April 2019 – The project( Website design and development ) was confirmed by Mr. Chamindra and the project was handed over to our project management team 
On 8th May 2019 – Our team has sent the design to your team ( Mr. Chamindra )
Our team has sent several messages and called Santani team but still did not get any green light on the design. 
Later there was no improvements in the project and also Mr. Chamindra left and Alice took over 
Please note there is a delay period of almost 6 months 
On 14th November 2019 – Our team and Alice had a introduction meeting , went through the web designs and Alice told that she will be providing the contents and images in one week 
On 15th November 2019 – Our team sent the finalized design links. 
Alice went through the designs and approved the design link. 
On 10th Dec 2019 – The mid payment was cleared. 
On 13th Dec 2019 – The mobile dedicated website and German language website was handed over to the project management team. 
The plan was to develop website and the dedicated website together and once that this done the German website will be developed after the contents are given by Santani team 
After that the project was put on hold as contents and images were pending from Santani team. 
On 26th May 2020 – Our team shared the beta link of the website and the mobile dedicated website to Santani team 
On 4th June 2020 – Santani team got back with the website beta changes and requested for a home page design change 
On 2nd July 2020 – Our team has shared some wire frame designs for the homepage and still waiting for the comments from Santani team. 
Usually once the design link is shared and confirmed , we do not go back and do any changes after the development but on special approval our management gave the approval on the wire frame designs 
The estimated timeline of a website revamp and dedicated mobile site development is 8 – 10 weeks which is approx 3 months but because of the delays on Santani team this project is dragging from 2nd April 2019 which is almost 15 months which is not a favorable way to work as it impacts everyone. 
Our Accounts Team has been following up on balance invoices but there has been no clear indication on the clearance as well 
Considering all of the above and the slow progression of the project we will disable the link shared so that it will give your team the time needed to reflect and come back with a simpler approach to proceed. Along the same side please be kind and help clear the financial obligations directly with Sales Team or Accounts.
We are always here to assist as needed however its vital that both teams (BWW & Client name) work in unison & the same frequency so that there is a good balance between expectations & actual project needs.
We hope you understand the entire email content in the same spirit that it is written 🙂 Awaiting a favorable reply.

CHANGE CLIENT NAME
Hi XXX ,
Greeting From Benworldwide!
We are happy to assist with the suggestions requested for, the prime motive behind these suggestions is so that the images have the power to convey your business message ; connect with your audience and thereby help build a strong brand story.
Key points which we need to highlight would be the Image Resolution ; Background Clarity ; Photo Specifications (eg: JPG (.jpg/.jpeg), GIF (.gif), PNG (.png), or BMP (.bmp) files etc)
After discussing with team about the brainstorm session on photograph ideas for both products and creative shots , we are pleased to offer our suggestions that can help your team accordingly:
1.	photographs of the plantations – Depicts the expanse of Mabroc Business
2.	photographs of CSR activities – Depicts to the audience how Mabroc does more to the society
3.	photographs of tea processing – The Uniqueness of Tea Manufacturing Process
4.	photographs of products – This is critical aspect of the photography as this is where your product is put in context.
5.	Photographs of Leadership board (both solo shots and group photographs) – The seriousness of the business and the team behind it all
Apart from the above our aim should be to able to connect with a worldwide audience all around and the best approach to the same is CREATING A BRAND STORY – basically how your brand connects with the regular todos of people & their lifestyles.
we conducted a research and found few useful links to get a better idea they are as follow. please refer:

Site revamp needed email format
February 2, 2021 
Version 1 sites works fine
Subject: Important Considerations for the Future of www.lmfgroup.lk
Dear ,
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a pivotal opportunity to enhance www.lmfgroup.lk to ensure its continued success in today’s ever-evolving digital landscape. As the website has been live for about 4 years now, it’s an ideal time for a comprehensive review and revamp. Here are some essential reasons why:
1. Enhanced Security
Emerging Threats: With the progression of time, newer security threats emerge. Revamping ensures that your website is fortified against the latest risks.
Software Vulnerabilities: Updated systems will protect against potential vulnerabilities present in older versions.
2. Improved Backend Performance
System Optimizations: Modernizing the backend can lead to faster page loads, improved server response times, and an overall smoother user experience.
Better Maintenance: Newer systems are more streamlined, making future updates easier and less time-consuming.
3. Plugin Upgrades
Functionality: Updated plugins offer more advanced features and are more compatible with modern systems.
Eliminate Redundancy: A revamp can help remove outdated or unnecessary plugins, thus improving site speed and functionality.
4. Refreshed UI/UX
Modern Aesthetics: Internet aesthetics evolve, and an updated look can enhance your brand image, showing your users that you’re keeping pace with the times.
Optimized User Journey: Modern design principles ensure intuitive navigation, leading to better user retention and engagement.
5. Aligning with Newer Trends
Stay Competitive: With competitors constantly updating their platforms, a revamped site ensures you remain at the forefront.
Modern Features: Incorporating latest website features, such as chatbots, interactive modules, or AI-driven elements, can vastly improve user interaction.
6. Compatibility with Latest Technologies
Browser Updates: Ensure the website is fully functional and displays correctly across all modern browsers.
Mobile Optimization: With a rising number of mobile users, a site revamp will ensure it’s fully optimized for all devices.
7. Updated User Behaviors
Changing Habits: As user online habits evolve, it’s crucial our site evolves too, ensuring we cater to the newest user behaviors.
Improved Analytics: Modern platforms offer better insights into user behaviors, helping tailor content more effectively.
In summary, a revamp isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s a comprehensive update that covers security, functionality, user experience, and staying ahead in the competitive landscape. By investing in these updates for www.lmfgroup.lk now, you’re safeguarding its success for years to come.
Please let me know when would be a good time to discuss this further. Looking forward to enhancing our platform together!
Warm regards,

Version two site slow
Dear XX
We spent about X days working on your site. We do understand there are issues and it is slow
The main reason for this is the site is outdated
When a site is launched it is not perpetual, eventually there is a life span and it takes a toll
You may wonder how is this possible as these are static codes and typically a client has been paying hosting and maintenance over the years to keep it going.
Let us explain a little in detail
A site works on the following collaborations
1/ User (Technical knowledges and understanding)
2/ User Laptop browser (usually Chrome or Safari)
3/ Users computer (usually a Mobile or Windows or Mac)
4/ Servers (usually Linux which is on the BWW side)
5/ Server OS (which is something like WHM or Cpanel)
6/ Plugins used on the site (FB, Google Analytics and other integrations)
7/ Your site – The website BWW creates
When you launch a site we mainly do point number 7, based on the current standards of points 1-6. But over the years points 1-6 go through rapid expansions and developments. Your site (point) generally keeps up a few years but three plus years it start showing signs of slowdown and eventual death.
As you can see your site requires a desperate overhaul and what you are seeing are the first signs of problems
We do hope you understand our situations
Let us know we will be glad to put in touch with you with our sales department
Thank you

When clients delaying Beta confirmation / Requires payment (Email draft)
September 26, 2019 
Following email is sent when a client is taking a lot of time to get back regarding beta confirmation while delaying the balance payment. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Dear XX,
Hope you’re doing well!
This email is in reference to the Beta confirmation from your end for us to proceed to the next step; Launch the website.
I understand that you require time to circulate among the Board and their sign-off.
Just to clarify we have taken the comments at the design stage and proceeded to the development stage, completed the development and shared the beta site. After sharing the beta link, we have made all the requested changes and modifications in the beta site.
For example, when you see the site next month and come back with changes it becomes an issue, although you see the changes as small as it is a beta site. When we do a change it can affect other areas and our work gets complicated.
Considering there will be changes and tweaks on the website, such as below we can do which are minor.
•	Font size changes
•	Font colour changes
•	Text content changes
•	Image changes
•	Icon changes
However, it has been over xx days/months since sharing the beta site. The technology keeps changing continuously and we don’t recommend keeping the Beta site as it is for a long time.
Moreover, please note that we have now freeze the files and stored the site on beta and at the same time awaiting your confirmation to launch.
Kindly note that the launch procedure takes time and cannot be done within one day. Our team requires time to plan the work therefore, please do inform the board regarding this so that there are no confusions.
Here are a few guidelines for you to decide when to launch.
•	Team has to do the final round of QA checking.
•	We require at least 3 days, in order to prepare the files to go live.
•	We don’t recommend to launch on Thursdays or Fridays. Once we have launched the site, we are doing a complete check for any broken links, domain issue or any other technical matters. Since the development team is not seated at the office during the weekend there can be instances where it will take some times to attend to the same.
Hence please consider above mentioned points carefully and decide the site launch within days Monday to Wednesday.
Prior to proceeding with the launch, the balance payment has to be cleared. Please get in touch with our Sales team to clear the finances.
Hope this explains and looking forward to your reply with Beta confirmation.
Thank you.
Best Regards,
XX

Guideline to handle external service providers better
December 13, 2018 
 
1.	If you are working with them for the first time, get an idea of them from your colleague, who already hold an experience.
2.	Get the marketing approval and the details on the project type you are going to work with them. Each type depends on the hours.
3.	Prepare and share a full document on what you need from them. This must be very detailed about the features, changes or any content updates you require. Make sure this is shared before they start the work.
4.	There is a document with a set of basic development guidelines they supposed to practice. That must be shared with very project brief. Download here!
5.	Make sure they are fully aware of what you need.
6.	Get an acceptable delivery date from them. Make sure you get a final product to test, without getting it part by part. (Can differ based on the situation)
7.	Make sure to minimize the number of times you go back with comments/issues.
8.	Prepare a google sheet with all the comments and issues and share it with them. Actively update if when you find any issues.
9.	Once all the work is done, share the Cpanel logins with them and get the files uploaded.
10.	Inform marketing team once everything is completed to settle the payments.
11.	If you have any new modifications, which is not informed during the project brief, ALWAYS check with the party whether they can do it before promising anything to the client.
12.	Clear communication is a key factor. Make sure your instructions are very clear. Avoid unnecessary back and forth communication.
13.	Always use emails. If you make a call or WhatsApp, always back it up with an email.
14.	Be friendly, understanding and professional at the same time.
15.	Never let your clients know about the external service providers.

Client taking time to launch (Dragging)
Dear XX
I understand that you require time, however this project has been long overdue. We developed this site and released the link on xxxxx
It has been xx months. The tech keep changing continuously and we cannot keep the BETA site as it for a long time
We need to freeze and launch. For example when you see the link next month and come back with changes it becomes an issue, although you see the changes as small as it is a BETA site when we do a change it can affect other areas and our work gets complicated
Therefore I implore you to sit and come back with a finalized go ahead prior to xxxx
If we don’t hear from you by then we will freeze and store the site. Please understand any changes which is needed can be complicated in the future and sometime even can mean a fresh revamp
I will await your final decision
Thanks
XX
Communication pass to support format

Dear XX
Nice to hear from you!

Design Submission format
Dear XX
We have studied the requirements carefully and attached herewith our design submission
http://sample.com
Please note that this is only for “visual approval” and the links/verbiage and images has been entered only as a guide to accentuate the design. The links/verbiage and images can be changed at development stage.
Please carefully review the design and submit the comments, please take time if needed to review, as once the coding has progressed it will be difficult to change certain areas. Hence we recommend that all changes be done at the design stage, which is now.
Awaiting your valuable feedback.
XX
Need for maintenance agreement
Dear XX
Currently you have a website and booking engine hosted with us
We need a maintenance agreement as your solution is dependent on the following;
The user (knowledge standards)> Browsing Hardware (Machine) > Browser and version > Programming code > Virus Guard > Framework > Server > Operating System > Bank IPG
All these elements keep changing daily. For example, our server gets upgraded always to ensure latest upgrades and software. When that happens some elements may stop working, which require troubleshooting.
This is the reason why we request for maintenance agreements
Furthermore when something works yesterday & stops working today, it cannot be supported free of charge. Someone has to look into it to see the root cause and fix the issue. In some cases it can be our issue and these are not charged as per the server agreement.
Hope this explains, that the environment is much more complex than you imagine and trust you will push for a maintenance agreement urgently.
Thank you
Project hand over Premature (Before launch)

I am always there to assist in anyway needed and I will also keep an eye the first few days until you get comfortable with the support team. Any urgent issues, you can always drop me an email or contact me via Whatsapp/Skype.

As an when the contents are ready, you can email support@benworldwide.com and one of the agents will help you enter the yyy (contents/images) and finalize the project.
I hope this is fine with you? In case you require any special assistance you can always email me and I will be glad to help.
Please confirm for me to pass the project to our support team

Client entering contents and delaying launch need payment
Hi XX
Good Morning!
Thank you for sending the contents. We will add these to the website. After adding the contents, since we have completed the website development, I need to close the project from my end.
Although I close it from my side you can still continue to contact me for any assistance needed until launch. I would assist you personally or put in touch with the relevant associates who can refine the product as needed till launch.
But as a part of our closure can you get in touch with XX from Marketing to clear any balance finances.
Please get in touch with me for any questions?
Thank you

Client wants unreasonable page loading speeds
Hi XX,
Page loading speed is a complex issue and it depends largely on
•	The page size (Images, video, text, code, scrips)
•	Framework Speed
•	Server Speed
•	Cache
•	User computer specs
•	User Internet Speed
While there is no standard norm it is better to keep the page speed as low as possible, having said that it also about conversions. Example if you look at Google which is one of the fastest loading pages on the net, it does not have any heaving content, just a basic image and a form, so it loads it less than a second, at the same time if you look at a travel site with video and content it loads in maybe 10 secs. The travel site can remove all the main video and large images and make it 3 seconds but what is the point if a user comes to home page and does not covert meaning give you business.
Hence at BenWorldwide we try to find the optimum loading speed to keep the page speeds low and the same time give you conversions.
You cannot use a global norm, example; if a page does not load within a specified number of seconds the users goes away. The reality is even if the users stays to check a page which does not have convincing information, anyway the users will not convert which is the same as the user going away. But the latter even has a negative brand communications as opposed to the first which is just a drop off.

Follow up email after launch 3 days
Dear XXX,
Good morning.
Hope you are doing well?
I hope you like the new look of the website after the launch 🙂
If you are doing any changes and when doing testing, we highly recommend to do the testing after logging out from the back end instead of using development mode (backend logged in) or can use incognito mode of your browser to do the testing and see the changes.
Please keep a close eye on the site for the first few days and please confirm If all the features and forms are perfectly functioning.
I am there for any help you may need
It was nice working with you on this project.
If you have any queries, please feel free to reach out to us.
Have a great day!
Stay safe!
Best regards,
XXX

Golden Rules in client managetment
February 8, 2014 
Seek to Understand the Big Picture
The best companies  — the ones who deliver the most value to their clients — take the time to learn about their client’s business (and personal) goals and objectives. They ask smart questions and do lots of listening. They understand how the particular digital matter they are being asked to handle fits into the big picture. It’s also a smart idea to understand the dynamics and trends of the industry in which your client competes. Visiting your new client’s place of business is also a great way to get things started on the right foot (If their located nearby).
Give respect
There should be absolutely no reason under the sun for us to not give the due respect to everyone we are in touch with. No one will want to give his best effort and creativity for a client who doesn’t show respect for him. Similarly, whether it is a senior or a junior even internally, it is respect that will put wheels on your work and will open doors.
Think consumer first
From Mahatma Gandhi to P&G to LG, they’ve all laid emphasis on consumer-oriented thought process. In fact, the going slogan at P&G is “Consumer is Boss!” The murkiest of situations become clear and solutions emerge if we look at things from our consumer’s point of view. Whether it is Design, web development, Software or Social media, thinking for consumer will give you winning ideas. It is, though, easier said than done because you need an insight into how consumers think and behave before you can claim to be consumer oriented. So, build a habit of devoting time and resources to understanding your consumers. It never fails!
Impart knowledge.
Customers and clients look to us to provide something they don’t have, whether that’s a particular kind of expertise or a specific kind of service or solution. We do them a disservice, however, when we try harder to sell to them than we do to inform them. Consider every contact an opportunity to bring something of value to them. After all, they paid for it. HOWEVER ENSURE THAT YOU DON’T GIVE SPECIFIC TRADE SECRETS OUT, you can explain the results and not the solution. For example you can say our global CMS but not WordPress.
Establish Your Client’s Expectations and Then Exceed Them
Walk your client through how you propose to handle the project and what he can expect in terms of results and timelines. Create a reasonable set of expectations and do your best to beat them. If you discover you are unable to meet your commitments, or the results are not likely to be what you anticipated, share that information with the client as soon as possible. In almost all cases, you will be forgiven.
Follow Through on Your Commitments
Set reasonable deadlines and do your best to follow through as promised. If you promise a project of the contract in three weeks, deliver it in two. Nothing aggravates a client more than a broken promise. It also has a very serious negative consequence when it comes to building trust.
Always Promptly Return Telephone Calls
Nothing upsets clients more than an unreturned phone call. It’s the #1 complaint clients have about companies. You may not think a return phone call is all that important (especially if there is nothing to report), but your client sure as heck does. Adopt a policy to return all your calls on the same day. It’s a darn good habit.
Communicate with Your Client in the Manner He Prefers
Ask your new client the method and frequency of communication he prefers and deliver your updates and progress reports accordingly. If you can’t be flexible, tell your client up front how you operate. Ensure that every bit of communication is documented by an email.
Introduce Your Client to the Team Working on His Matters
Take the time to invite your new client to BWW to meet the team who will be working on his matter. However have a clear line of communication protocols so that the client does not contact and trouble the developers.
Show Your Client That You Appreciate His Business
In every small thing, a tea, a snack, a chocolate, show a touch of kindness. Invest time in building the relationship. Holiday cards and birthday reminders are a must, know tour clients birthday and anniversaries.
Learn to love your client
All above cannot be done if you dont show genuine care and interest for your client. If you are cannot do that it is better to inform the seniors and hand over the client to someone else than to continue and do something which you dislike.

SERVERS AND HOSTING
October 13, 2012 
If Client Requests Web Files After The Hosting Termination (Email Draft)
January 11, 2023 
In case the client get back to us after we terminate the hosting account
Dear Client
When we terminate a site, we terminate all the local backups as well
However, there will be a possibility to recover the server from our mirror back ups which we do for servers off shore (Disaster recovery method)
It is a costly and time-consuming process
1/ We will have to create a close server based on a past mirror back up time
2/ We will have to configure the OS
3/ We will mirror and copy the server based on the time stamp
4/ We will set up the server with the relevant account
5/ We will then migrate the specific account to the normal server
6/ We will have to them delete the temp server
Once the site clears the payment let us know to proceed
Thank you

Your solution online is a very important one but what people don’t realize is that every lead is more important as that the reason why your solutions exists
There may be a few ways your client can contact you offline (phone, WhatsApp, FB) however the main form which is the inquiry form or web email email remains the most used form
We don’t use traditional email server from local host as they are not reliable. Therefore, we used advance email servers which professional API and 100% delivery assurance. These professional servers are checked every minute for authenticity and anti spam which ensure a perfect delivery.
The last thing you want is to loose a lead which can cost thousands or millions
Therefore the charge is for BWW uses email API from external vendors to send your leads, inquiries, order emails, etc.
The scope on the service is below :
Email account management
API Configurations
Port Monitoring
Spam monitoring
Delivery tracking monitoring
Email API account management

Hope this clarifies your concerns.
PS if the cost is high for you we can use a free service however we cannot assure email deliveries.
Thank You
Rising annuals costs
October 13, 2021 
Dear XX
The 2021 has been a very challenging year due to rising cost, rising malware, more attacks in our servers and the dollar rising conversion rates. Our credit cards were blocked to pay for the server with restrictions and we had to go through massive difficulties to make payments to the off shore hosting and support companies
World over there is a rise is costs for information technology and information technology based human resource asserts.
We are compelled to increase the rates for 2022 and if you still calculate this you are still only paying a nominal fee is XX USD per month
Don’t get fooled by penny servers offering small amount to host site. The issue is the upkeep and the support which costs a lot of time, resources and money
Thank you for your continued partnership

Email hosting disclaimer
October 23, 2012 
BWW only hosts websites and web based solutions, we discourage email hosting, in the event a client request we have the following drafted reply
 
Hi XX
With reference to emails
We don’t support emails for clients as it poses a lot of technical issues to us. In a few instances we gave emails using the server without support. But clearly this is not going to be a good solution for you. When you say an email does function there can be innumerable reasons for that;
1)      Net connection
2)      Firewall blockage of the recipient
3)      SPAM settings of the recipient
4)      In case of POP access the IP address of the sender is blacklisted
5)      Corporate clients which use pro blockers such as Barracuda
6)      DNS configurations
7)      Server settings
8)      Sometimes even manual errors
So in reality as your business grows bigger you need a professional email service. We both locking horns on email delivery is not going to be a solution as it is just impossible to trouble shoot these as and when the issue arises.
Usually small businesses have their own servers and in the case they don’t have the server they usually settle for Google enterprise or Zoho email solutions
We will be glad to assist you in the migration
Thanks

External hosting disclaimer
February 21, 2013 
If a client wants to host a site externally the following disclaimer email is sent
 
Dear Client,
With reference to sites hosted on External servers –  from a management perspective on clarity of file transfers we wish to keep you informed well in advance that  we cease support upon file transfers as we do not have any control on the hosted environment.
For the websites hosted on our servers we host we provide the following
•             Server Hosting Management
•             Server uptime 99.9% assurance
•             Server security and hardening
•             Bandwidth monitoring and control
•             Error management and breakdown service
•             CMS upgrades

•             24/7 trouble shooting
We value your business and would not want any miscommunication to take place and hence the need to keep you pre-informed.
When a site is hosted externally we expect the new server admin to take care of all above issues and we take it that you understand clearly that we will not be held responsible for anything that goes wrong with regard to the site.
Please let us know if you would need any further clarifications on the same.

Virus attack reply
February 21, 2013 
If a client is demanding info on VIRUS ATTACKS you may use the following reply
 
Dear Client,
Unfortunately these are errors that cannot be  predicted. On the same note please be assured that our technical team works round the clock and makes every attempt to protect your online solution however there are certain parameters  not within our span of control.
Virus attacks are instances that can happen to any website and as a development team we ensure we rectify & fix them when it happens. We have already taken the necessary security measures but there are always exceptions that could occur in the fast moving IT world.
We are not dismissing the fact that this occurrence may not have happened in the past however we need to make you aware viruses are being developed by the minute and recently these have grown in sophistication. While our technical team runs a thorough check to ensure web safety  and avoid attacks and worms, it is fighting factor to ensure a full proof system always as we live in a dynamic IT environment.
Full proof systems like  ‘bullet proof hosting’ are being used by web users like CNN and BBC and they have a start up cost of  thousands of dollars per year !!
We trust and thank you for understanding the context of the email. As always we are glad to support whenever needed.
Sincerely,
XYZ
